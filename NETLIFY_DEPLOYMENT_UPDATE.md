# Netlify Deployment Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Static Files for Netlify Deployment

#### index.html
Created a basic index.html file in the public directory that:
- Provides a loading screen during page transitions
- Automatically redirects to the main application
- Supports both light and dark mode
- Ensures proper client-side routing with Netlify

#### styles.css
Added a dedicated CSS file for the loading page that:
- Provides responsive styling for the loading screen
- Implements proper dark mode support
- Adds subtle animations and visual improvements
- Ensures consistent styling across devices

#### loading.js
Created a JavaScript file that:
- Handles the redirect logic with a small delay for better UX
- Detects and applies the user's theme preference
- Provides animated loading messages
- Ensures compatibility with the Next.js application

### 2. Updated GitHub Workflow

Modified the GitHub Actions workflow file to:
- Copy all public files to the .next directory during build
- Ensure static assets are properly included in the deployment

### 3. Enhanced netlify.toml Configuration

Updated the Netlify configuration to:
- Add proper caching headers for static assets
- Maintain existing API route handling
- Preserve client-side routing configuration

### 4. Improved Build Script

Updated the netlify-build script in package.json to:
- Copy public files to the .next directory after build
- Ensure all static assets are included in the deployment

## Why These Changes Were Needed

Next.js applications deployed to Netlify require special handling for client-side routing. The index.html file serves as a fallback for client-side routes and ensures proper navigation. The additional configuration changes ensure that static assets are properly served and cached.

## Testing the Deployment

After pushing these changes to your repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy to Netlify. You can verify the deployment by:

1. Checking the GitHub Actions tab for successful workflow completion
2. Visiting your Netlify site URL
3. Testing navigation between different pages
4. Verifying that static assets load correctly
