# PDF-Parse Module Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Issue

When deploying to Netlify, the build process was failing with the following error:

```
Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - D:\StudyGenie\test\data\05-versions-space.pdf
```

This error occurs because the `pdf-parse` module attempts to access test files during the build process when it's loaded.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes to resolve this issue:

1. **Custom Wrapper**: Created a custom wrapper for pdf-parse in `lib/pdf-parse-fix.js` that avoids accessing test files:
   ```javascript
   // Custom wrapper for pdf-parse to prevent test file access during build
   const Pdf = require('pdf-parse/lib/pdf-parse.js');
   
   module.exports = Pdf;
   ```

2. **Updated Imports**: Modified API routes to use this custom wrapper instead of directly importing pdf-parse:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   import pdfParse from "pdf-parse"
   
   // After
   import pdfParse from "@/lib/pdf-parse-fix"
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` in the build environment to prevent test code execution:
   - Added to `netlify.toml`
   - Updated build scripts to use `cross-env NODE_ENV=production`
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow

## Implementation Details

- Added `cross-env` as a dev dependency
- Updated `netlify-build` script to use `cross-env NODE_ENV=production`
- Added `NODE_ENV = "production"` to the `netlify.toml` file
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use `npx cross-env NODE_ENV=production`

## Verification

The fix was verified by running a test build with:

```bash
npx cross-env NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

The build completed successfully without any errors related to the PDF test files.
